## About The Project
It can be extremely time-consuming to perform a stocktake/inventory of a large number of assets such as books in a library. Libraries used to keep track of their books using barcodes but since RFID technology has become more mainstream, many libraries have switched to a system of RFID stickers and readers.  

This project aims to provide an easy and affordable way to perform a large scale stocktake of RFID tagged assets.

### RFID Readers
The RFID reader used for developing this program was a 3M TTS810. It can read multiple [ISO/IEC 15693](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_15693) RFID tags at once with a read range of up to around 30cm. This allows it to be moved along books on shelf to capture each book ID.

The software is designed to make it easy to implement a new reader.
